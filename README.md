# Differential Geometry Animations (2019)

This is a p5.js sketchbook for differential geometry simulations.
I started reading *Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces*
by Manfredo P. do Carmo, and decided to try to implement some of
the parametric curves mentioned in the book.

## Curves from _Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces_

* Cycloid
* Cissoid of Diocles
* Tractrix

## Other Curves

* Fireworks [Project Euler #317](https://projecteuler.net/problem=317)
